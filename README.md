# Tested with PonyTown 0.28.4-alpha version!
### And I gotta credit [Keupoz](https://github.com/keupoz), since it's basically his idea.

# What does it do?
This script adds "link" button to outline selections, into character editor.

Basically, it enables pixel-precise outline color setting, so it matches either main color, or shade color.
* If button is...
   * **Bright** - will toggle between __main color__ and __shade color__. Try clicking twice!
   * **Grey** - will set outline matching __shade color__.
   * **Disabled** - outline cannot be set. Try picking another color!

:sparkles: Made 100% without game code modification. :sparkles:

# How do I install?
1. Install Tampermonkey userscript extension for your browser. However, you may install any other, but I recommend this one.
* [Tampermonkey for Chrome / Microsoft Edge / Safari / Firefox / Opera Next / Dolphin Browser / UC Browser](http://tampermonkey.net/)
2. Add userscript by clicking here: [[Install userscript]](https://github.com/Neeve01/PonyTown-Outlines/raw/master/PonyTown_Outlines.user.js).
3. If you already had opened PonyTown tabs, don't forget to refresh!

# Troubleshooting
* Nothing happens when clicking button.
  * Press **Ctrl + Shift + I**, check your **Console** for errors.
* There's no buttons added at all.
  * If PonyTown was updated recently, just wait for me to update userscript.
  * No? Probably a browser issue. Try updating it, and if it won't work anyway, send me details about your browser.
